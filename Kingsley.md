Day 1 >

Git : I learnt that git is a VCS (Version control system), it helps track changes in project code over time. Git make us track every change we make on our project, allow us go back to the previouse code on our project, and it allows multiple people collaborate on a project without conflict.


Day 2 >

Gitflow : At first i thought Gitflow is a feature on Github, so on day2 i realize Gitflow is just a way of organizing a project using Git branches. It give a clear structure for how to work on the peoject, for example, creating branches for each of the sections on the project, let say creating a [feature/] branch for the project features, or [release/] for preparing a new release and [hotfix/] for bugs quick fix
